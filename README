*** WARNING ***

This branch (ADODB) of ATBBS is VERY unstable.  In fact, 65% or more of the board is broken at time of writing.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

============================
INSTALLATION
============================

Your host must have PHP version 5.2 or greater. To check your host's version of PHP, create a page called test.php with the content "<?php echo phpversion() ?>". If it's less than 5.2, do not install ATBBS.

You need MySQL, Apache 2 (with mod_rewrite turned on), and lots of fucking patience.

To get started, visit http://yourbbs.com/install/, you'll then be walked through the installation process.

STUFF BELOW HERE IS OLD AS SHIT

- Create a MySQL database. Navigate to the database in phpmyadmin. Click the "import" tab and, as the file to import, select INSTALL.sql from the zip. Click Go.
- Edit the database details in /includes/config.php. For example, if your database is named 'durrbbs', change line 8 to 'database' => 'durrbbs' .
- Edit the other settings in config.php. In particular, change the DOMAIN definition to your domain.
- Upload the ATBBS files (except INSTALL.sql) to your root public directory.
- Go to the back up ID page (yourdomain.com/back_up_ID). Replace ADMIN ID HERE in config.php with the ID found on that page. You are now the administrator.

============================
NOTES
============================

- File encoding must always be UTF-8 _without BOM_. I recommend modifying files with Notepad++.
- If image uploading is enabled, /img/ and /thumbs/ need to be chmodded to 777. Your FTP client can do this.
