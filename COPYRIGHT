Despite claims to the contrary and a huge amount of fraudulent DMCA takedowns, this software is legitimate (licensed under the MIT).

Although it appears similar to AnonTalk (the site creating all the fuss), the HTML and backend sourcecode was designed using the Clean-Room Design process (look it up on Wikipedia).  tl;dr None of this is copied, it was created by hand, especially since the sourcecode to AnonTalk was never made public.  

Also, any more false DMCAs and I will counterfile.
